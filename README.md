# Password-Generator-Challenge
## Generating A Secure Password

--- Overview
Given a starter code I will add functions and declare variables to generate a random password. 
The random password should meet specfic requirements, prompt, and alert if any missing information.
The password should contain 8-128 characters, numeric values, special characters, lower and upper case letters.

### The Challenge:
I have been given a starter code my job is to generate a password using that code. I will create
a random password that contains 8-128 charcters, numbers, special characters, upper and lower case letters.
This password will generate when the generate button is clicked. It must contain and meet all requirements in the
case that it does not it will then alert the user and have them try again. 

### User Story:
"AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security"

### Acceptance Criteria: 
"GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page"

## My Process:
After reviewing the in class activites, rewatching the lectures, and doing outside research I learned how to break down my code to make it easier to read.
After breaking it down I was able to create different functions, create arrays and declare certain variables that helped me develop my code. I also created 
if statements, alerts and prompts to guide the user when generating the password.


### Built With:
Javascript

### What I Learned:
From this challenge I learned how to start coding with Javascript. I learned how to create function and declare variables. I also learned how to create arrays,
if statements, booleans, and how to concatenate in my code.
